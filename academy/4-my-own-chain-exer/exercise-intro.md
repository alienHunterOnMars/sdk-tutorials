# My own chain as an exercise

## How to proceed

This module is about creating a decentralized game of Checkers using Ignite CLI and the Cosmos SDK. Each section progressively advances the project. To learn the most efficiently, you should treat each section as _a solution_ to the exercise described before the corresponding section.

You are not tested on this, it is just in your best interest to do so.
